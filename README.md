## Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe

### Usage
Start the server by running Server.jar, preferably from the command line with `java -jar Server.jar 9000 100`. Last two values are the server's listening port number and client limit. Default values of 9000 as a port number and 100 as client limit are used if none specified.

The client application may be possible to launch with a double click but this depends on an operating system and its file assocations. If it's not possible, then it should be done via the command line with `java -jar Client.jar`. Enter the server's host address and its port number in the window and press Connect button to get into the server.

### Building
Open Server, Client and Common projects in NetBeans IDE, then build Server and Client projects. Common project should be automatically used as a library for them. Executables will be deployed inside dist directories along with shared library.

### Implemented
